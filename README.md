# Radiant-Fuel

Radiant Fuel is a software solution that I developed for a fuel delivery. The main objective of the project was to improve the customer experience and the operational efficiency. The software allowed customers to place and track their orders for fuel tanks. The software also enabled the company to collect and analyse data on the fuel consumption and levels of each customer, and to generate weekly reports that helped optimise the delivery.
